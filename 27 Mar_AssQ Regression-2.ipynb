    "1. Compare Models: When you are comparing multiple regression models with different numbers of predictors, the adjusted R-squared provides a better basis for model comparison. It penalizes models that have too many predictors, preventing overfitting and favoring simpler models that are more likely to generalize well to new data.\n",

Adjusted R-squared helps mitigate this issue by accounting for the number of predictors, encouraging the use of a more parsimonious model that avoids unnecessary complexity.\n",

Select Significant Predictors: When adding new predictors to the model, the adjusted R-squared can help determine if the new variables contribute significantly to explaining the variation in the dependent variable.

    "\n",
    "1. Outliers Impact: RMSE and MSE can be strongly influenced by outliers because of the squaring operation. A few extreme outliers can inflate these metrics significantly, making them less robust to extreme data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No Directional Information: RMSE and MSE only consider the magnitude of the errors and do not provide any directional information about the deviations. This means they cannot distinguish between overestimation and underestimation of the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sensitivity to Scale: RMSE and MSE are sensitive to the scale of the dependent variable. If the dependent variable has a large range of values, the error metric can be large even if the model performs well in relative terms.\n",

    "4. MAE's Disadvantage: While MAE is less sensitive to outliers, it lacks the advantage of penalizing larger errors more heavily, which might lead to less accurate models in certain cases.\n",
